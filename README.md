Title: PREDICTING CLAIM AMOUNTS (INVOICED AMOUNT) FOR MEDICAL COVER PATIENTS

About: As an insurance company, being able to predict the amount of money a patient is likely to claim after securing medication in a certain health facility is key. It helps the insurance company predict the amount of money it will likely use to settle claims as well as avoid being defrauded. In this project, I try to predict claims based on various metrics collected by a certain insurance company. I collected data from one insurance company that shows various invoices from customers and accompanying personal information. It is this data that I will be using to create a model that predicts the claim amount given various parameters
